This guide explains the setup for creating and presenting interactive slides for ECON 2B03.

## 1. Setup

### Workspace
**Always open the root folder** (`chrismuris.github.io`) in your editor (e.g., VS Code or RStudio).
-   Why? Your site configuration (navbar, theory, etc.) lives in the root (`_quarto.yml`).
-   **Rendering in Subfolder**: You *can* `quarto render` from the `econ2b03` terminal, and Quarto will find the root config. However, your editor (IDE) might lose context for autocompletion and project-wide search.

### Directory Structure
-   **Slides**: `econ2b03/slides/Part_Name/*.qmd` (organized by part)
-   **Config**: `econ2b03/slides/_metadata.yml` (controls settings like `footer` and `theme`)
-   **Theme**: `econ2b03/slides/metro-seahorse.scss` (Custom styling)
-   **CSS**: `econ2b03/custom.css` (Style for master-only content)
-   **Extensions**: `econ2b03/_extensions/` (Shared extensions)

## 2. Creating Slides

Enable `multiplex` and link the custom CSS in the YAML header:

```yaml
---
format:
  revealjs:
    multiplex: true
    css: ../../custom.css
---
```

### Master-Only Content

Use a div with the `.master-only` class. This content will appear on your screen (the master) but be hidden on student devices (clients).

```markdown
::: {.master-only}
⏱️ **Wait 2 mins** | Secret Code: ALPHA
:::
```

### Quarto-Quiz

Add the `.quiz-question` class to the slide header. Mark the correct answer with `[]{.correct}`.

```markdown
## Question Title {.quiz-question}

Which is correct?
- Wrong answer
- [Correct answer]{.correct}
- Wrong answer

**Explanation:** Optional explanation text.
```

### Webexercises

Use R code chunks with the `webexercises` library:

`````markdown
```{r}
#| results: "asis"
library(webexercises)
cat("Question text", fitb("answer"))
```
`````

## 3. Presenting

1. **Prepare**: Open the slide deck on your laptop. This is the **Master** view.
2. **Share**: Provide the standard URL to students.
    - **Tip**: Link to `slides/deck.qmd` in your index page, and Quarto will automatically resolve it to `.html`.
3. **Multiplex**: to enable synchronized advancing, you need to generate a `multiplex` file.
    - *Note: Standard `multiplex: true` works for async viewing. For synchronous control, you may need to generate a JSON file with secrets. See Quarto documentation for "Multiplexing".*

## 4. Updates

- **Slido/Forms**: Replace placeholders with actual embed codes/links as needed.
