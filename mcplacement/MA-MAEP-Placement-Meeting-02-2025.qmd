# Introduction
<!-- 
Our session will be a semi-interactive workshop designed to help you craft compelling CVs and cover letters. The meeting will have two parts:
- A short presentation on effective writing strategies for application materials.
- A hands-on workshop where you will work in small groups to exchange constructive feedback on your documents. Peer review is one of the best ways to improve your writing.
To ensure you get the most out of our time together, please come prepared ...

For the volunteers:

- We can then schedule a meeting to discuss a rewriting strategy together. This may help you get a head start on your materials.
-->

## Today's agenda

- **Writing** — Why "sweating the details" matters
- **Application components**
    - Cover letters
    - CVs
    - References
<!-- - **File management** — Naming conventions and organization -->
- **Interviews** — Preparation and practice
<!-- - **Digital presence** — LinkedIn and GitHub considerations -->
- **Workshop (optional/take-home)** — Exchange and critique materials

. . .

**Time:** ~45 minutes

## Before we dive in

- **Feedback welcome**: If you see ways to improve these meetings and other "placement support" at McMaster Economics, please tell me or email me.
- **Bring materials**: Have your draft **2-page CV** and **1-page cover letter** ready for the optional workshop at the end.
- **Collegiality**: You're on the **same team**. Help each other — have classmates read your materials and practice interviews together.

<!-- Other groups of students are doing this, and they will collectively beat you to these jobs if you do not collaborate. Helping your colleague get a good job may help you get a job with them later! -->

## APAP intake is open!

- Flagship federal government program.
- Deadline: November 3, 2025, 23:59 Pacific Time.

# Writing

## Write well — it matters

::: {.incremental}
- **Grammar and style** reflect your communication skills.
- Used as a **predictor of success** by employers and scholarship reviewers.
- When there's **1 position and 300 applications**, they need reasons to reject files.
- Young economists often harm their careers by not paying **as much attention to communication skills** as competitors in other disciplines.
:::

. . .

**Bottom line**: Writing well gets you the interview. Your other skills will do the rest.

## Sweat the details

You need to **check everything**:

- **Formatting** — Consistent fonts, sizes, spacing, alignment
- **Spelling** — No typos, even in names or organizations
- **Punctuation** — Spaces after periods, proper comma usage
- **Articles** — Correct use of "a," "an," "the" (common issue for non-native speakers)

. . .

**Many rounds of revision are normal.** A sentence like this is enough to stop an HR officer, or the [AI in an ATS system](https://studentsuccess.mcmaster.ca/job-applications-applicant-tracking-systems-ats/) from reading:

> "Strong grasp on economic theory having taken several honours only courses which are similar to graduate school level course."

Issues: "on" vs. "of," "course" vs. "courses," awkward phrasing.

## Common writing pitfalls

- **Articles (a/an/the)**: Common problem for non-English speakers and some native speakers. See [Cambridge Grammar Guide](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/a-an-and-the).
- **"Faux-formal" writing**: Trying to sound fancy and falling flat. Write clearly and directly.
- **Sentence fragments**: If you use periods, write full sentences. 
    - Not fragments that look like sentences. 
    - #$%# I just did it.
- **Consistency**: Pick a style (bullets with/without periods, date formats, ...) and stick to it.

. . .

### How to fix this if you are bad at it?

- Practice, practice, practice.
- Iterate with friends, LLMs (with care), and your placement officer.
- Read aloud.
- More resources: see meeting 1 slides.

# Application Components

## What you'll typically need

Applications usually require some combination of:

1. **Cover letter** (or statement of interest) — Write for your **audience**!
2. **CV** (or résumé) 
3. **References** — Sometimes a list on CV, sometimes letters
4. **Transcripts** (sometimes)
5. **Application forms** (sometimes — web-based portals)

. . .

**Federal government**: 

- Formal process with **Public Service Entrance Exam**, which tests
    - writing
    - judgment
    - personality
    - ...

## Employer advice

From recent employers who hired our students:

> "Read carefully what the posting is looking for, and don't provide anything that's not requested in the job posting, unless you explain it in your cover letter. For example, if you really think you should include a paper you've written but they haven't asked for it, address in your cover letter **why** you're including it."

. . .

> "Unless the job posting asks for it, **do not include your transcript** with your application package."

. . . 

> "Make sure you **customize your cover letter** for the job. If you're not willing to put in the effort to customize your cover letter, then that signals to the employer that you're not really interested in the job."

. . .

> "You may also consider **customizing your résumé** for a job. Highlight the aspects of your previous jobs that closely align with the job you're applying for."

<!-- . . .

> "If the hiring manager opens themselves up to being **contacted** about the job, make sure you do it, even if just to ask more about the type of work. It shows you're interested in the job, and makes your name stand out." -->
<!-- **Use judgment** on this last point! -->

## Alumni advice

Based on a conversation (October 8, 2025) with a recent grad, about applying to a co-op:

> I submitted 10 packages in total. I personalized 3. I got 3 interviews...

# Cover letters

- No writing mistakes. Cover letter has to be perfect. This is a screening margin.
- **Personalize** every letter. The opening lines should **not** be generic.
- **Look at the job ad** — make sure to respond to the issues raised.
- Reference your **interest in and/or fit with** the specific job/organization.
- You need **key words** from the job ad in your cover letter or you may be excluded.
- Think about the humans and machines that will read your letter.
- Especially in the **private sector**, computer programs/HR firms do a "first sort."

## Cover letter: Optimal structure

1. **Header** — Name · Email · Phone · LinkedIn · *(GitHub if relevant)* · City, Province
2. **Date** and **Recipient block** — Person/Team, Organization, Division/Branch *(address optional for email)*
3. **Re:** *Application for [Role] at [Organization] (Posting [ID])*
4. **Opening (≤4 sentences)**: Role + source; 1–2 sentence value proposition in mandate language; concise thesis of fit
5. **Evidence paragraph(s)**: Map **Essential** qualifications (and top **Asset** items) to **STAR** mini‑cases (methods/tools + measurable outcomes)
6. **Fit & motivation**: Why this organization/division? Reference one initiative/policy area; connect skills to mandate
7. **Closing**: Logistics *(availability, attachments)*; courteous ask; sign‑off

**Formatting (ATS‑friendly):** 

- One column, left‑aligned,  keep to **one page**.
- Standard headings; no text boxes/images; export as **selectable PDF**.
- Mirror posting language.

<!-- You can select, copy, and search the text (Ctrl/Cmd+F), and software (ATS parsers, screen readers) can reliably read it. -->

## Cover letter ingredient 1: Header

<!-- PII = personal identifiable information -->
- **Include**: Name · professional email · phone · LinkedIn · *(GitHub if relevant)* · City, Province.
    - If using LinkedIn: make sure it is complete and matches your resume. 
    - Recruiters will look at it, and inconsistencies raise flags.
- **Conventions**: One line (or two lines), left‑aligned, plain text; no headshot; no full street address; links must work.
    - Links like [this](google.com), not like [https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/102/3/518/96782/Efficient-GMM-Estimation-with-Incomplete-Data](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/102/3/518/96782/Efficient-GMM-Estimation-with-Incomplete-Data).
<!-- - **Federal signals (optional, if true)**: Language ability; clearance eligibility (briefly in closing rather than header). -->
- Style:
    - Keep the header visually light; recruiters focus on content below. 
    - Check that links work in the exported PDF.

## Cover letter ingredient 2: Date and recipient block

- **Purpose**: Targets the letter to a specific competition and audience; aids routing and audit.
- **Include**: Date, Recipient name/title (or team/committee), Organization, Division/Branch; address optional for email submissions.
- **Salutation**: See next slide.
- **Consistency**: Organization and division names exactly as in the posting.

---

### Salutations

Preferred:

- Dear [Team Name] Hiring Committee:
- Dear [Department Name] Team:
- Dear HRSDC Co-op Applications Manager,
- Dear Ministry of Health Hiring Committee:
- Dear [Person's name]:

OK, but a bit dated:

- Dear Sir or Madam:
- Dear Hiring Committee:

Not OK:

- "Hi" (too informal) — err toward **formality**

Style:

- Watch gender (get it right or avoid)
- Spaces after punctuation

## Cover letter ingredient 3: "Re: line"

- **Purpose**: Identifies exact competition; improves searchability and routing.
- **Content**: Role title; Organization/Division; Posting ID (if provided).
- **Placement**: On its own line, directly above the salutation; bold for skimmability.
- **Style**: Mirror the posting’s capitalization and wording (e.g., *Junior Policy Analyst*, not *junior policy analyst*).
- Standard in public sector. 
    - For private sector roles, use if posting includes reference number or if unsure.

### Common mistakes in "Fit and motivation" paragraphs:

**Don't:**

- Talk about what the organization will do for YOU ("training opportunities," "professional development")
- Use generic praise that fits any company ("innovative," "dynamic," "collaborative culture")
- Mention values without connecting to specific work ("commitment to excellence")
- List multiple areas of interest without depth ("I'd be interested in X, Y, or Z")
- Claim you're "drawn to" or "passionate about" without evidence

**Do:**

- Name a **specific initiative, program, report, or publication** (with date if possible)
- Connect **your concrete skills/project** to **their specific work**
- Show you've done **recent research** (mention 2024/2025 developments)
- Focus on **what you'll contribute**, not what you'll gain
- Reference **how you learned** about their work (if applicable: attended event, read report, spoke with employee)

## Cover letter ingredient 7: Closing

**Purpose**: Confirm logistics, express availability, and end courteously without weakening your application.

**Formula (2–3 sentences):**

```
[Attachment] + [Availability] + [Thanks]

[Sign-off],
[Your name]
```

**Sign‑offs:**

- Sincerely, *(standard, always safe)*
- Best regards, *(slightly less formal)*
- Respectfully, *(very formal government)*

### Three standard versions

**Version 1 (minimal):**
```
I have attached my résumé. I am available for an interview at your convenience. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
```

**Version 2 (with role):**
```
I have attached my résumé and am available to discuss the Policy Analyst position at your convenience. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
```

**Version 3 (multiple attachments):**
```
I have attached my résumé and writing sample as requested. I am available for an interview at your convenience. Thank you for considering my application.

Respectfully,
[Your name]
```

---

### Extensions for special cases

Add **one contextual element** only when genuinely relevant:

**Referral:**
```
Thank you to [Name] for connecting me with this opportunity. I have attached my résumé and am available to discuss how my experience aligns with [Team/Division]. Thank you for your consideration.
```

**Event follow-up:**
```
Thank you for the conversation at [Event] in [Month]. I have attached my résumé and am available to discuss this opportunity further.
```

**Specific timeline:**
```
I have attached my résumé and am available for interviews throughout [specific months] before my [reason: teaching term concludes/graduation]. Thank you for your consideration.
```

**Key principle**: Use the standard formula for 95% of applications. Only add context if it strengthens your application.

---

### Common mistakes

- "I look forward to hearing from you soon" *(puts pressure)*
- "I hope you will consider me" *(sounds uncertain)*
- "Please feel free to contact me" *(obvious; wastes words)*
- "I would be honored/thrilled/excited" *(save for interview)*
- "At your earliest convenience" *(sounds pushy)*
- "Repeating your qualifications" *(already made your case)*
- "Repeating contact info" *(already in header)*
- "Going over 3 sentences" *(too long)*

## Cover letter, final checks

**ATS‑friendly formatting rules:**

- **One column, left‑aligned**; no text boxes, tables, images, or headers/footers.
- **Standard fonts**: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (11–12pt).
- **Save as selectable PDF** (not scanned image; not Word unless posting requests it).
- **Test**: Can you select, copy, and paste text from the PDF? If yes, it's ATS‑friendly.

. . .

**Formatting for human readers:**

- **One page**.
- **White space**: small breaks between sections; standard margins.

. . .

**Tips**

- Let someone else review it (fresh eyes catch errors you'll miss).

:::

. . .

**Do NOT:**

- Rate skills with bars/stars (subjective)
- List basic skills ("Microsoft Word," "Email")
- Exaggerate proficiency (you may be tested)

## CV ingredient 5: Additional sections (optional)

**Projects** (if you lack work experience):

- 1–3 significant projects (capstone, thesis, research assistantship)
- Format like work experience: title, dates, 2–3 bullets with tools and results
- Example: "**Housing Affordability Analysis** | Jan–Apr 2024  
  - Analyzed 10 years of CMHC data using R  
  - Built predictive model achieving 85% accuracy; presented to class of 30"

## Formatting & ATS


**Formatting:**

- **ATS-friendly**: One column, left-aligned, **selectable PDF**
    - Clear section headings
    - Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (10–12pt)
    - No text boxes, tables, images, or graphics
- **Consistency**: Same date format, bullet style, verb tense throughout
- **White space**: Use margins and spacing; don't cram
- **Length**: One page strongly preferred for students; two pages acceptable if you have substantial relevant experience

**Length:**

- **Students/early career**: One page strongly preferred
- **Two pages acceptable** if you have substantial relevant experience (multiple internships, significant projects, TA roles)
- Never go to page 2 with only 2–3 lines
- Don't pad to fill space; don't cram to fit one page

**Visual consistency:**

- Same fonts, limit different styles
- Same bullet style throughout (• or –, not both)
- Same date format (Jan 2024 or 01/2024, not both)
- Same verb tense within sections
- Consistent spacing and indentation

---

**Content:**

- **Most recent first** within each section
- **Quantify results**: Numbers, percentages, outcomes
- **Demonstrate, don't state**: Show skills through examples, not course lists
- **Tailor for each job**: 
    - Highlight relevant experience
    - Different jobs emphasize different skills
    - ATS systems scan for keywords from posting
    - Shows you read the posting carefully

**How to tailor (15–30 min per application):**

1. **Reorder bullets**: Put most relevant experience first
2. **Mirror posting language**: Use their exact phrases ("quantitative analysis" not "statistical work")
3. **Adjust skills section**: Move relevant tools to top
4. **Emphasize relevant projects**: Expand descriptions that match posting
5. **De-emphasize or remove**: Irrelevant experience can be shortened

**Maintain a master CV** and adjust emphasis for each job—don't start from scratch.

## Common mistakes

**Content errors:**

- Objective statement ("Seeking a challenging position...")
- "References available upon request"
- Listing duties instead of achievements
- Using first person ("I analyzed..." → "Analyzed...")
- Including irrelevant old work
- Just listing courses instead of showing what you did

**Formatting errors:**

- Multiple columns or text boxes (breaks ATS)
- Fancy fonts, colors, graphics
- Inconsistent dates, bullets, or verb tenses
- Walls of text without bullet points

**Credibility errors:**

- Typos or grammar errors
- Exaggerating skills or results
- Unprofessional email address
- Broken links
- Generic CV not tailored to posting

<!-- ## Academic vs. industry focus

**Academic CV emphasizes:**

- Publications, conference presentations
- Teaching and research roles
- Thesis/dissertation
- Grants, fellowships

**Industry/Government CV emphasizes:**

- Measurable work outcomes
- Technical skills and tools
- Communication and collaboration
- Project deliverables and impact

**For MA students applying to government/industry:**

- Lead with **work experience** showing results
- Name **technical skills** prominently
- Frame **academic work as projects** with deliverables
- You can include publications/conferences, but as supporting evidence, not the main selling point

**Key difference**: Academic CVs show scholarly contributions; industry CVs show what you delivered and how.

--- -->

## Cover letter + CV: The package

Remember they work together:

- **Cover letter**: Tells a story; explains fit; highlights 1–2 key qualifications with STAR examples
- **CV**: Comprehensive list of all relevant experience and skills; scannable format

**Consistency is critical:**

- Job titles, dates, organization names must match exactly
- Skills mentioned in cover letter must appear in CV
- Don't contradict yourself across documents

**Before submitting:**

- Cover letter references specific role and organization
- CV is tailored to emphasize relevant experience
- Both documents use keywords from posting
- Both are saved as professional PDFs with clear filenames
- If submitting by email, the email itself is professional and error-free

# References

## Finding and managing references

- **Find references early**.
- Sometimes a letter is required; sometimes only name and contact info.
- Increasingly, references are **phone calls**, not letters. If you know which, let the person know early.

. . .

- **Ask directly**: "Will you be able to provide me a **good** reference?" (without going overboard)
- A **good** reference from a less well-known person is better than a mediocre or negative reference from a "famous" person.

## References: Diversity and content

**Diversity helps**:

- Especially for **private sector**, have someone who can say you:
  - "Know how to roll up your sleeves and work hard"
  - "Are a good colleague"
  - It's not all about academics (though some of it is)

. . .

**Provide the reference with materials**:

- Marks, statement of interest, background material
- Indicate if there's anything special
- **2–3 pages is good; 8–10 pages is bad** (don't swamp them)

## References: Limits and logistics

Act with your reference letter writer in mind:

- Be nice to your reference letter providers.
- If applying to many positions, the reference writer will usually provide a **generic letter**, but may be willing to provide 1–2 **targeted** letters.
- Most reference writers will be **reluctant to provide you** with a written reference directly — they prefer to send it directly to the employer.

<!-- 
# File Management

## File naming conventions

**Why it matters**:

- You may send **one file**; the recipient may receive **hundreds of submissions**
- Good filenames help you stay organized and help employers track your materials
- Many organizations have detailed file naming conventions

. . .

**What makes a good filename**:

- Identifies **you**
- Identifies the **recipient/job**
- Identifies the **content**
- Includes a **date**

## File naming examples

**Example for a co-op at TD Bank**:

- `Muris-ApplicationTDCoop-2Oct2025.pdf`

. . .

**Avoid**:

- Generic names: `CV.pdf`, `CoverLetter.pdf`, `Application.pdf`
- Numbers for dates: `2102025` — Is this Feb 10 or Oct 2?
- Special characters or spaces: `CV (final) v2!.pdf`

. . .

**Best practices**:

- Use **dashes or underscores**, not spaces
- Spell out months: `2Oct2025`, `Oct2-2025`, `2025-10-02`
- Be consistent across all files in an application package

## Organization beyond applications

**Apply these principles broadly**:

- For **assignments** submitted electronically to McMaster
- For **research** projects and data analysis
- For **keeping yourself organized**

. . .

**Use directories sensibly**:

```
/Documents
  /JobApplications
    /FederalGovernment
      /BankOfCanada
      /StatisticsCanada
    /PrivateSector
      /RBC
      /Deloitte
  /Coursework
  /Research
``` -->

# Interviews

## Preparation is essential

**Before the interview**:

- **Dress well** — Better dressed than the interviewer is not unusual
- **Basic hygiene** — Wash, brush teeth, etc.
- **Be polite yet relaxed** (without going overboard on either)
- **Get a good night's sleep**

. . .

**Research and preparation**:

- **Stay up-to-date on current events** related to the job (read business section, check economic indicators)
- **Know the organization** — Check their website, recent news, key initiatives
- For economist roles: Brush up on relevant subfields (e.g., Industrial Organization for Industry Canada)
- **Prepare questions** to ask — Shows seriousness and interest

## Interview practice

**Practice with peers**:

- Form groups of **2–3 friends**
- Practice answering **"standard" interview questions**
- Practice **asking questions** (asking sensible questions indicates seriousness)
- **Do not let practice turn into "rote responses"** — avoid going too far

. . .

**Remember**:

- This is a **formal environment**
- **Read your email and check your phone** — Some students apply but don't check for callbacks for 2 weeks. Good way NOT to gain employment!

## Standard interview questions

Be prepared to address:

- Why are you interested in **this organization**?
- What are your **strengths and weaknesses**?
- Describe a time you **solved a problem** or **worked in a team**.
- Where do you see yourself in **5 years**?
- What relevant **skills** do you bring?
- What questions do you have **for us**?

. . .

Think about how to **demonstrate** (not just claim) your:

- Quantitative/statistical skills
- Writing and communication abilities
- Strategic thinking
- Teamwork and collegiality

---

## Job-specific questions

- Interview can have very specific questions.
- Be ready to demonstrate your domain-specific knowledge, including responses to follow-ups from the panel.
- Depending on the division, may ask:
    - Specific questions about methodology or program evaluation.
    - How the CPI is constructed. 
    - The pros and cons of different policies that impact emissions.
    - ...


<!-- 
# Digital Presence

## LinkedIn

**Why it matters**:

- Recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates and vet applicants
- Your profile is often the **first impression** after your CV
- Networking tool for informational interviews and connections

. . .

**Key elements**:

- **Professional photo** — Headshot, business casual, good lighting
- **Headline** — Not just "MA Student" — add specialization: "Economics MA Student | Data Analysis & Policy Research"
- **About section** — 2–3 paragraphs highlighting your skills, interests, and what you're looking for
- **Experience** — Include RA work, projects, relevant coursework with deliverables
- **Skills & endorsements** — Add relevant technical skills (Stata, R, Python, econometrics)

## LinkedIn: Strategy

**Building your network**:

- Connect with **classmates, professors, alumni** from McMaster Economics
- Follow **companies and organizations** you're interested in
- Join groups like **CABE/TABE**, economics/policy groups
- Engage with content (like, comment thoughtfully on posts from economists/orgs you follow)

. . .

**Job search features**:

- Set your profile to "**Open to work**" (visible to recruiters only, not your network)
- Use **LinkedIn job search** — many postings are LinkedIn-exclusive
- Apply through LinkedIn when possible (easier for recruiters to review your profile)

## LinkedIn: Best practices

**What to avoid**:

- Unprofessional photos (cropped group photos, party pics, too casual)
- Typos and grammatical errors (yes, this matters here too!)
- Generic connection requests ("I'd like to add you to my professional network")
- Over-posting or posting controversial content

. . .

**What to do**:

- Keep profile **up-to-date** (add new skills, projects, certifications)
- Write **personalized connection requests**: "Hi [Name], I'm an MA student at McMaster interested in [field]. I noticed your work at [org] and would love to connect."
- Ask for **recommendations** from supervisors, professors (similar to references)
- Share relevant content occasionally (research, articles) to stay visible

## GitHub

**When GitHub matters**:

- Positions requiring **coding, data analysis, or technical skills**
- Research assistant roles
- Tech companies, data science roles, quantitative positions
- Demonstrating your **portfolio** of work

. . .

**What to include**:

- **Pinned repositories** — Showcase your best 3–4 projects
- **README files** — Explain what each project does, methods used, results
- **Code quality** — Clean, commented, reproducible code
- **Documentation** — Installation instructions, dependencies, how to run
- **Contributions** — Even small contributions to open-source projects show engagement

## GitHub: Strategy

**Building your presence**:

- Make repositories **public** for portfolio projects (unless proprietary)
- Link your GitHub in your **CV and LinkedIn**
- Include projects from:
  - Course assignments (with permission)
  - RA work (if allowed)
  - Personal projects (data analysis, replication studies)
  - Hackathons or competitions

. . .

**Best practices**:

- **Commit regularly** — Shows ongoing engagement (green squares matter)
- **Organize repositories** — Use clear names and folder structures
- Write **meaningful commit messages** — Not "update" or "fix"; be specific
- Keep a **clean profile** — Archive or delete abandoned/messy projects

## GitHub: What employers look for

When employers check your GitHub:

1. **Can you write clean, functional code?**
2. **Can you document and explain your work?**
3. **Do you follow best practices?** (version control, reproducibility)
4. **Are your projects relevant** to the role?

. . .

**Quick wins**:

- Create a **profile README** — A landing page for your GitHub with intro, skills, contact
- Fork and contribute to **economics/data repos** (e.g., replication packages)
- Show **progression** — Early projects can be simple; recent ones should be polished -->
