The number of students who will be accepted into the WIL stream of the relevant program will be small and may change over time.\nAdmission to the stream does not guarantee a placement. Working with information available to the department and through their own efforts and contacts, a WIL stream student will compete for and apply for positions on their own. These positions can be held anywhere in the world.\nTo complete the WIL stream, students must work in either one or two placements and successfully complete both ECON 796 and ECON 797. A student who fails to complete both courses will be switched back to the regular stream of the program that they are enrolled in. Both of these courses are for credit and are Pass/Fail. Registration in these courses will be restricted to students who have a placement that has been approved by the Econ 796 or Econ 797 course instructor as appropriate. In addition, PhD students must get permission from their supervisor. PhD students will normally enter the WIL stream having passed all comprehensive examinations as well as the research paper.\nA placement must include a significant research opportunity. At the completion of four months of a placement, the student must write an academic report discussing the work undertaken in light of their academic studies and must request a letter of evaluation from the mentor(s). These documents must be judged satisfactory by the course instructor to successfully complete either ECON 796 or ECON 797 as appropriate. Successful completion of these courses will be indicated on the student’s transcript. In the event that the student does not complete the full term of a placement, the student will drop the course and join the regular stream of their program.\nInterested Masters students should normally register for the WIL stream associated with their Masters program (MA or MAEP) at the beginning of term 2 of the first year of their program. Because of the nature of hiring, it is sometimes not known which students will be doing each placement until the month before that placement commences. Students who do not find a position can switch back into the regular stream of their program.\nStudents taking Econ 796 or Econ 797 by working at a placement while still enrolled in other courses are expected to fulfill requirements of these othercourses outside their placement work hours. While registered in either ECON 796 or ECON 797, a student will be considered a full-time student and will pay term tuition."
