    "text": "9.2 Funding — internal & external (early!)\n\nStart early. Internal timelines are very early; many applications take more time than you expect.\nInternal (host university)\n\nMinimum stipends (e.g., MAC Econ PhD) and internal awards; often automatic if you apply early; larger awards may require extra steps.\n\nExternal (agency/foundation)\n\nOGS — open to visa students and citizens/PRs; minimum A- (10.0/12); “over-time” students (e.g., 2nd-year MA in a 1-year program) not eligible; internal SGS deadline early Oct/Nov. Scholarships overview\nSSHRC (Talent): $20k/yr (CGS-M), $35k/yr (Doctoral); Vanier $50k/yr; CIHR $50k/yr (plus research stipend in some cases). SSHRC: Talent · CIHR: Apply through SGS\nRouting: You can apply to one of CIHR or SSHRC. Unsuccessful SSHRC/CIHR applications are usually shifted to OGS automatically — if eligible, you may as well apply.\nOther foundations: Trudeau Foundation — Program; Commonwealth Scholarships; IDRC (topic-specific) — Funding page.\n\nBottom line: deadlines are crazy early; strong applications require 100% effort — partial effort is usually wasted."
