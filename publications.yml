  abstract: "This paper analyzes how interaction effects can be consistently estimated under economically plausible assumptions in linear panel models with a fixed T-dimension. We advocate for a correlated interaction term estimator (CITE) and show that it is consistent under conditions that are not sufficient for consistency of the interaction term estimator that is most common in applied econometric work. Our paper discusses the empirical content of these conditions, shows that standard inference procedures can be applied to CITE, and analyzes consistency, relative efficiency, inference, and their finite sample properties in a simulation study."

We establish sufficient conditions for the identification of the regression coefficients, the time-varying link function, the distribution of counterfactual outcomes, and certain (time-varying) average partial effects. We propose estimators for these objects and study their asymptotic properties. We show the relevance of our model by estimating the effect of teaching practices on student attainment as measured by test scores on standardized tests in mathematics and science."

This parameter is a building block for most partial and marginal effects of interest in applied practice."

  abstract: "This paper presents a dynamic model of inventory and trade to examine how importers manage demand uncertainty when importing involves an order lead time. We demonstrate that when import costs are low, the optimal strategy for an importer is to maintain a safety inventory of imported goods, exceeding expected sales, to handle demand surges. However, as import costs increase, firms shift their hedging strategy from relying on safety inventory to employing dual sourcing. This involves covering demand surges with readily available but more expensive domestic supplies, while continuing to use imports for base-level demand. Our results indicate that this endogenous adjustment of the hedging strategy leads to a greater reduction in the volume of inventory and imports than the expected sales as import costs rise, an effect that is further amplified by an increase in demand uncertainty."

Our identification results accommodate unobserved heterogeneity in resource shares, as well as unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity in the individual-level demand functions. We propose a GMM estimator for the parameters of interest and study its asymptotic properties. We apply our method to study the resource shares of men and women in Malawi."

  abstract: "This paper considers the identification and estimation of a fixed-effects model where the dependent variable is interval-censored. We explore two versions of the model: a parametric model with logistic errors and a semiparametric model where the errors have an unspecified distribution. In both models, error disturbances can be heteroskedastic across cross-sectional units, provided they are stationary within a cross-sectional unit. The semiparametric model also accommodates serial correlation of error disturbances. We propose a conditional-logit-type composite likelihood estimator for the logistic fixed-effects model and a composite maximum-score-type estimator for the semiparametric model. These estimators generally identify the scale of the coefficient parameters. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to birthweight outcomes are used to demonstrate the performance of the parametric estimator."

Examples include unbalanced panels and instrumental variables settings where some observations lack certain instruments. I propose a model for these scenarios where observations may be incomplete, with an arbitrary number of incompleteness strata. I derive a set of moment conditions that generalizes those found in Graham's (2011) standard missing data setup, establish the associated efficiency bound, and introduce efficient estimators."

  abstract: "We analyze a stochastic dynamic finite-horizon economic model with climate change (SDICE*), which incorporates potentially heavy-tailed stochasticity into Nordhaus' deterministic DICE model. We show that the expected utility framework, particularly with constant relative risk aversion, is fragile when confronted with heavy-tailed distributional assumptions that model economic catastrophes. We derive necessary and sufficient compatibility conditions for the utility function to avoid this fragility, ensuring that expected (marginal) utility remains finite. We develop and implement a regression-based numerical method for solving this class of models. Numerical results suggest that higher levels of uncertainty lead to less abatement and consumption, and more investment, which can be substantial depending on the nature of uncertainty and social preferences."

First, it estimates the differences in the cut points along with the regression coefficient, leading to provide bounds on partial effects. Second, the proposed estimator for the regression coefficient is more efficient. The author uses the fact that the ordered logit model with J outcomes and T observations can be converted to a binary choice logit model in (J - 1)T ways. As an empirical illustration, the paper examines the income-health gradient for children using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey."

Using an arguably superior group fixed effects estimator, we find that the relationship between income inequality and per capita emissions depends on the level of income. We show that for low and middle-income economies, higher income inequality is associated with lower carbon emissions while in upper middle-income and high-income economies, greater income inequality is associated with higher carbon emissions."

This paper introduces a data-driven method for averaging estimators across various candidate specifications to address the uncertainty in model specification when using propensity score weighting to estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). The proposed procedures aim to minimize the estimated Mean Squared Error (MSE) within a local asymptotic framework. Model averaging is framed as a statistical decision problem in a limit experiment, leading to the derivation of an averaging scheme that is Bayes optimal. The averaging estimator demonstrates superior performance compared to selection estimators. Monte Carlo studies and an application to a labor market program illustrate the gains in MSE achieved by this method."

Our results are relevant to various fields encountering catastrophic consumption risk in cost-benefit analysis."

We estimate a gravity model of migration, augmented with average temperature and precipitation in the country of origin, using a panel data set of 142 sending countries for the period 1995 to 2006. Temperature is positively correlated with migration, and changes in precipitation are also associated with small changes in migration. These effects are robust to various model modifications. The study also explores the channels relating climate changes with migration via agriculture and internal conflict."

  abstract: "In searching for an appropriate utility function in the expected utility framework, we formulate four properties that we want the utility function to satisfy. We identify Pareto utility as a function satisfying all four desired properties. Pareto utility is a flexible yet simple and parsimonious two-parameter family. It exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and increasing but bounded relative risk aversion. It is applicable irrespective of the probability distribution relevant to the prospect to be evaluated. Pareto utility is therefore particularly suited for catastrophic risk analysis. A new and related class of generalized exponential (gexpo) utility functions is also studied."

The model captures the effects of variations in surface solar radiation, using information over the period 1959–2002 from observational records (GEBA), as well as increases in greenhouse gases on surface temperature. The model performs well with respect to observational data and is simple enough to admit a rigorous statistical analysis. This allows us to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimated parameter values using observational data only. The methodology directly yields estimates with corresponding confidence intervals, which can be translated into confidence intervals for climate projections. Specifically, we construct probabilistic climate projections using standard scenarios for carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions."

The purpose of this research is to identify these two effects using a simple climate model and data from a large number of weather stations worldwide for the period 1959–2002. The parameters are estimated using dynamic panel data methods, and the associated parameter uncertainty is quantified. The estimated temperature change of 0.73°C is decomposed into a greenhouse effect of 1.87°C, a solar radiation effect of -1.09°C, and a small remainder term."

We explicitly distinguish between these factors to identify long-run neighborhood effects. We estimate an ordered probit model of neighborhood choice and use it to infer how population shares of parental SES in each neighborhood vary along both observed and unobserved dimensions. We then regress the average observed outcomes in neighborhoods on these population shares to identify potential outcomes. Using race-based neighborhood sorting as an instrument, we estimate that about half of recent racial inequality in intergenerational mobility is explained by residential segregation."

  abstract: "We introduce a new framework for characterizing identified sets of structural and counterfactual parameters in econometric models. By reformulating the identification problem as a set membership question, we leverage the separating hyperplane theorem in the space of observed probability measures to characterize the identified set through the zeros of a discrepancy function with an adversarial game interpretation. The set can be a singleton, resulting in point identification. A feature of many econometric models, with or without distributional assumptions on the error terms, is that the probability measure of observed variables can be expressed as a linear transformation of the probability measure of latent variables. This structure provides a unifying framework and facilitates computation and inference via linear programming. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to nonlinear panel models with fixed effects, with parametric and nonparametric error distributions, and across various exogeneity restrictions, including strict and sequential."

  abstract: "We study estimation and inference for triadic link formation with dyad-level fixed effects in a nonlinear binary choice logit framework. Dyad-level effects provide a richer and more realistic representation of heterogeneity across pairs of dimensions (e.g. importer-exporter, importer-product, exporter-product), yet their sheer number creates a severe incidental parameter problem. We propose a novel ``hexad logit'' estimator and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality. Identification is achieved through a conditional likelihood approach that eliminates the fixed effects by conditioning on sufficient statistics, in the form of hexads -- wirings that involve two nodes from each part of the network. Our central finding is that dyad-level heterogeneity fundamentally changes how information accumulates. Unlike under node-level heterogeneity, where informative wirings automatically grow with link formation, under dyad-level heterogeneity the network may generate infinitely many links yet asymptotically zero informative wirings. We derive explicit sparsity thresholds that determine when consistency holds and when asymptotic normality is attainable. These results have important practical implications, as they reveal that there is a limit to how granular or disaggregate a dataset one can employ under dyad-level heterogeneity."

  abstract: "We consider ordered logit models for directed network data that allow for flexible sender and receiver fixed effects that can vary arbitrarily across outcome categories. This structure poses a significant incidental parameter problem, particularly challenging under network sparsity or when some outcome categories are rare. We develop the first estimation method for this setting by extending tetrad-differencing conditional maximum likelihood (CML) techniques from binary choice network models. This approach yields conditional probabilities free of the fixed effects, enabling consistent estimation even under sparsity. Applying the CML principle to ordered data yields multiple likelihood contributions corresponding to different outcome thresholds. We propose and analyze two distinct estimators based on aggregating these contributions: an Equally-Weighted Tetrad Logit Estimator (ETLE) and a Pooled Tetrad Logit Estimator (PTLE). We prove PTLE is consistent under weaker identification conditions, requiring only sufficient information when pooling across categories, rather than sufficient information in each category. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical preference for PTLE, and an empirical application to friendship networks among Dutch university students demonstrates the method's value. Our approach reveals significant positive homophily effects for gender, smoking behavior, and academic program similarities, while standard methods without fixed effects produce counterintuitive results."
